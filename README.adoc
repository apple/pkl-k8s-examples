= Pkl/K8s Examples

== What's In This Repo?

The <<yaml/README.adoc#guestbook-yaml-manifests,yaml>> directory contains YAML manifests for the official _guestbook_ Kubernetes example.

The <<pkl/basic/README.adoc#basic-pkl-k8s-example,pkl/basic>> example demonstrates how to

* convert YAML manifests to Pkl
* evaluate Pkl manifests back to YAML
* catch manifest errors during evaluation
* apply Pkl manifests to Kubernetes.

The <<pkl/advanced/README.adoc#advanced-pkl-k8s-example,pkl/advanced>> example demonstrates how to manage Pkl manifests for multiple applications, deployment environments, and Kubernetes clusters.

To run the examples, install the {uri-pkl-install}[Pkl CLI].

== Why Pkl/K8s?

Kubernetes requires a lot of YAML configuration.
To make a single configuration change, users often need to touch multiple YAML files, which is time-consuming and error-prone.
Configuration errors aren't discovered until the configuration is applied.

{uri-k8s-templates}[Pkl/K8s], a set of {uri-pkl}[Pkl] templates derived from Kubernetes' OpenAPI spec, is here to save the day.
Writing Kubernetes manifests in Pkl offers the following benefits:

* Strong local validation that goes beyond Kubernetes' OpenAPI spec.
* Easy sharing of configuration across applications, environments, and clusters with the {uri-k8s-app-env-cluster}[AppEnvCluster] Pkl template.
  See the <<pkl/advanced/README.adoc#advanced-pkl-k8s-example,advanced example>> for details.
* Great IDE experience with validation, code completion, and direct access to Kubernetes documentation.
  Requires the {uri-pkl-intellij}[Pkl IntelliJ Plugin] for JetBrains IDEs (IDEA, GoLand, PyCharm, etc).

The {uri-k8s-convert}[io.k8s.convert] Pkl module automatically converts Kubernetes manifests from YAML to Pkl.
See the <<pkl/basic/README.adoc#basic-pkl-k8s-example,basic example>> for details.

Still unconvinced? See {uri-pkl-comparison}[Comparison] for the Pkl team's perspective on how Pkl compares to other configuration formats and languages,
